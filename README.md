# VendingMachine

-Implement a 30 cent vending machine on Spartan FPGA 601 board

Q1*: Design a coin machine that would dispense when it receives 30 cents. The coin machine can receive nickels, dimes and quarters. The balance remain after the dispensing can be used for the next instruction.

*In the implementation on FPGA board use LED A4 for dispensing without a balance, and C4 for dispensing with a balance. Push-Buttons P4, F6, and E4 to represent a nickel, a dime, and a quarter respectively.
